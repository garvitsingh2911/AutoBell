# 🔔 Automatic Doorbell with Object Detection

A mini-project built using Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensors, and buzzer to create a smart, hands-free doorbell system.

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect approaching objects or people automatically
- Trigger buzzer without the need for manual button press
- Enhance accessibility and convenience

## ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Buzzer
- Breadboard, jumper wires
- LED (for indication)

## 🛠️ How it Works
The ultrasonic sensor measures distance. When someone comes within a certain range, the Arduino triggers a buzzer and LED.
